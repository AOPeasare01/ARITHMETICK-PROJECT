# Instructions For Quiz Program
## ARITHMETICK
i. INTRODUCTION/ OVERVIEW:

WARNING : For full functionality of the program, run on Replit Online IDE! 

Arithmetick is a quiz program designed in a fun way to train brain lobes responsible for mathematical calculations and generally improve user cognitive abilities. Arithmetick consists of 10 levels, in order of progressive difficulty. If player goes far as completing the 8th, 9th and 10th levels, player earns the honorary Bronze, Silver and the ultimate Gold medals. After each level, the quiz allows player to continue or end per player discretion. At the end of player's journey, the level rank and award won is displayed. 

ii. HOW TO PLAY

Rule No. 1: DO NOT USE A CALCULATOR!


Before the start of each level, there is a brief warning of the time limit for answering in that particular level. There is also a short countdown to get the player ready for the round.Most importantly, player must be patient and not interfere with printing of the numbers to be computed. Submissions must only be made after the 'Enter your answer below:' instruction.

iii. RESULTS & GAME PROGRESSION

For wrong submissions from Level 1 to 4, player will restart from Level 1 to gain more experience with practice. Level 5 is the checkpoint. From here, player gets to restart the just-ended level that was failed. Wrong submissions include incongruity between player value and actual arithmetick solution and also lack of response within the required time. The program automatically closes submission entry after the time limit anyway. There is a performance review after every submission, showing the time used to make the entry, giving insight into player speed and accuracy.

iv. HOW TO QUIT/CONTINUE WITH QUIZ

To continue after each level, player must press Enter on keyboard. To quit, enter 'q' or 'Q' i.e Q + Enter. Anything apart from these submissions, warrants a repetitive display of 'Invalid entry'

v. HOW TO WIN

The best way to sail to the top is through constant practice and adherence to quiz guidelines. At the very beginning of the program, player gets to revise a briefer guideline on how to play or gets to skip if already too familiar with it.
